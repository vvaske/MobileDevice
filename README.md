MobileDevice
===============


MobileDevice-C# is the API interface library of iTunesMobileDevice under Windows.</br>

MobileDevice-C# was originally built with reference to Manzana's open source library, but because Manzana has stopped updating for many years, many functions cannot work properly, so some functions have been revised.</br>

MobileDevice-C# references the CoreFoundation library: https://github.com/isnowrain/CoreFoundation</br>
Gradually improve with time<br>
